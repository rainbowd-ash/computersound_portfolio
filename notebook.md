# Clipped
This is the assignment, plus a little more.

# Sin Wave Music
I have a dream of an ai radio show. One step of that is having the computer generate music, and this is step one of that process.

Future plans:
* Get RANDOM involved
* Make the songs longer
* Make the songs more interesting
* Add lots of variation

Random:
* Pick bpm, song length, song complexity
* Maybe have "moods", broad categories of song style
* Parse phrases into random seeds to make it deterministic

# Effects

Playing with splitting sounds into bass/mid/treble and then doing stuff with each segment
