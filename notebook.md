Next steps:
* Finish wah effect
* do some research on effects library so I don't have to implement them all by hand
* make an effects stacker (something that will run a wav through a bunch of effects in a row)
* presets for the effects stacker - instead of having it be a complicated command line thing, hardcode a couple presets

GREAT IDEA ALERT: make a mosquito noise generator that can I can overlay onto a track

I also need a program to combine two wav files. probably with a volume checker.

I think the mosquito effect can be combined with a wah effect.

This AI dj is really coming together as a concept. I want to it be pretty annoying, but also self-confident. so it's awful but it's obviously not aware of it.

I want to add some wet/dry mix args to my effects, and add a couple new effects. so that the ai dj can make things really wet when the weather is rainy.

# Clipped
This is the assignment, plus a little more.

# Sin Wave Music
I have a dream of an ai radio show. One step of that is having the computer generate music, and this is step one of that process.

Future plans:
* Get RANDOM involved
* Make the songs longer
* Make the songs more interesting
* Add lots of variation

Random:
* Pick bpm, song length, song complexity
* Maybe have "moods", broad categories of song style
* Parse phrases into random seeds to make it deterministic

# Effects
## FFT Tone Control
Playing with splitting sounds into bass/mid/treble and then doing stuff with each segment
